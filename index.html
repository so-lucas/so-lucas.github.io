                <p>
                    VPN‚Äùs are supposed to be private and secure, but they require you to trust them 100%.
                    Suppose there is a software that streamlines the process of creating your own VPN.
                    This software would enable users to set up their own personal VPN server, offering
                    them complete control over their data and privacy.
